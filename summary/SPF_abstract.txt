Time resolved direct imaging observations of planetary mass companions provide unique oppotunity to study the atomspheres of these objects. Patchy cloud cover, which is predicts by many exoplanet atomsphere model causes rotational photometric variability which will be caught and studied by this kind of observations. Rotation rate can also shed a light on identification of formation mechanisms of exoplanets. We performed HST WFC3 IR high-contrast, high-precision 2-color observation of 2 planetary mass companions. Our preliminary data reduction suggests HST has the ability to catch the small temporal variability of exoplanets. We found 2% variability on the light of AB-PIC b in both F125W and F160W observations. We will apply rotation phase mapping, a successful technique in brown studies to make further analysis.
