Time resolved direct imaging observations of planetary mass companions provide unique perspective to study the atomspheres of these objects. Patchy cloud cover, which is predicts by many exoplanet atomsphere models causes rotational photometric variability that will be detected and studied with this kind of observations. Rotation rate measurements also shed light on identification of formation mechanisms of exoplanets. We performed HST WFC3 IR high-contrast, high-precision 2-band observation of 2 planetary mass companions. Our preliminary data reduction suggests that HST has the sensitivity to catch the small temporal photometric variabilities of exoplanets. We found 2% variability on the light curve of AB-PIC b in both F125W and F160W light curves. We will apply rotation phase mapping,  a powerful technique proved to be successful in brown dwarf studies, to make further analysis with our observation data.
