Time resolved direct imaging observations of planetary mass companions provide unique oppotunity to study the atomspheres of these objects. Patchy cloud cover, which is predicts by many exoplanet atomsphere model causes rotational photometric variability which will be caught and studied by this kind of observations. Rotation rate can also shed a light on identification of formation mechanisms of exoplanets. We performed HST WFC3 IR high-contrast, high-precision 2-color observation of 2 planetary mass companions. With these data, we aim to verify the prediction of patchy cloud cover of planetary mass objects and make comparison to the cloud propeties of brown dwarfs. We will first apply rotation phase mapping that is proved to be a powerful technique in brown dwarf atomsphere studies to exoplanets. We also try to make the first direct measurements of rotation periods of wide-separation companions and put constraints on their formation mechanisms.
