Clarifications
>1) How do you scale (if you scale) the residuals you subtract?

The residuals are not scaled. I simply took the median of the
residuals that have the same dither position and position angle, and
subtracted the median combination from the original images. Since The
chisq distribution of the fitting looks very reasonable for me, I did
not attempt to make further adjustment of the residual models.

> 2) How do the residuals images look like? What is the relative fraction of the light that is not subtracted well?     
> 3) When you calculate the brightness of the sources, how do you use
> the information of the residuals and the TinyTim-based PSF?

These are very important points. However I did not deal with them very
carefully in my previous fit. As I showed in our previous discussion,
Tinytim does not provide a precise PSF model so that the residual of
tinytim PSF subtraction has a 2% - 4% average relative fraction of
original image(mean(residual/image) ~ 2%-%4). For the fitting routine I used this
time,  the fluxes of A and B purely calculated from the
amplitudes of the two components of the PSF. I did not count any flux
from the residual model into the fluxes of A or B.

An average relative fraction of 2-4% of the residual model could be a
significant source of uncertainty. Especially for the case that I
ignored the flux from the residual at all. However, I have not come up
with any ideas on including the residual flux to the final result. I
think we need further discussion about this point.

>a) When you say you carried out a "two component tinytim PSF fit", it is not clear to me what you mean.  I assume the linear superposition of two TinyTim PSFs.  But do you mean one for A and one for B that are otherwise identical (or perhaps different in some manner other than brightness?).  Or do you mean for B (and perhaps also A) you have used a combination  of TinyTim PSFs that, in combination (perhaps with different defocus of color terms?) better represent the observed PSF?        

I used different PSFs for A and B. My fitting routine firstly
generates a list of PSFs using the position of A and the NIR spectrum
of A (Bonnefoy et. al. 2014) with different telescope jittering. I fit
this PSF to the image of A with an area where the image of B is mostly
excluded ( using a 3-pixel radius mask centered on B) to find the best
matched position and Jittering. Next, I used this jittering to
generate a PSF of B with B's position on detector and B's spectrum
(Patience et al. 2010). In the third step, I fit the two PSFs together
with the position of A fixed , and to find the best matched position
of B and amplitudes of 2 PSFs.

The position depandency of the residual pattern comes from at least
three parts.

1. Instrumental as Glenn described
2. The imperfection of flat field is not modeled with TinyTim.
3. The PSFs are sampled differently at different position with a low
sample rate.

It is actually difficult to differentiate the improvement in terms of
different instrumental effect, since the there are significant
uncertainty and artifect generated by last two points.

I median combined the fluxes calculated with images taking with same
filter, dithering position and roll angles, and devided the median
combination from every photometric result of these exposures.

I binned the light curve of A and B by orbits. According to the result
I obtained, there are no clear correlation/anti-correlation betwee the
fluxes of A and B.

By eye, light curve of F160W does not show a sine-wave like
shape. Thus I do not trust the result of a least square fit very
much. The least square fit results in a sine curve with a period of
9.26 hr. I also tried to fit the F160W light curve with a sine curve
that has a fixed period of 10.9 hr. I plotted the two best fit sine
curves together with the original observation.

I did the fitting for A in both fittings. The rise in first three
orbits is the main feature that defines the sin wave in the
fit. However if it were truly part of a sin wave, the sine function is
not well constrained by this small segment. For the light curve of
F125W, the fitting routine found a best fitted curve with a period of
6.86 hr. However the points in the 5th orbit are totally off the
fitted curve. For F160W, the fitting routine failed to converge when
fitting a sine curve to the light curve.

I thought about this idea before. However, 10.9 hour is longer than the
observation baseline and we if that were the case, we did not have a
periodical signal. I was wondering whether the periodogram would work
for data that does not cover a whole period.
