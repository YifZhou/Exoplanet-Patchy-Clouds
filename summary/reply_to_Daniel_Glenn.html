<blockquote>
  <p>1) How do you scale (if you scale) the residuals you subtract?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The residuals are not scaled. I simply took the median of the
residuals that have the same dither position and position angle, and
subtracted the median combination from the original images. Since The
chisq distribution of the fitting looks very reasonable for me, I did
not attempt to make further adjustment of the residual models.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2) How do the residuals images look like? What is the relative fraction of the light that is not subtracted well? <br />
3) When you calculate the brightness of the sources, how do you use
the information of the residuals and the TinyTim-based PSF?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are very good points but I did not think about before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>a) When you say you carried out a "two component tinytim PSF fit", it is not clear to me what you mean.  I assume the linear superposition of two TinyTim PSFs.  But do you mean one for A and one for B that are otherwise identical (or perhaps different in some manner other than brightness?).  Or do you mean for B (and perhaps also A) you have used a combination  of TinyTim PSFs that, in combination (perhaps with different defocus of color terms?) better represent the observed PSF?        </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used different PSFs for A and B. My fitting routine firstly
generates a list of PSFs using the position of A and the NIR spectrum
of A that comes from Bonnefoy et. al. 2014 with different telescope
jittering. I fit this PSF with an area where the image of B is mostly
excluded ( using a mask of 3-pixel radius centered on B) to the image
of A to find the best matched position and Jittering. Next, I use this
jittering to generate a PSF of B with B's position on detector and B's
spectrum that comes from Patience et al. 2010. In the third step, I
fit the two PSFs together with the position of A fixed , and to find
the best matched position of B and amplitudes of 2 PSFs.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>b) To me it is interesting (but not really unexpected) that binning
by "same position angle" (i.e., spacecraft roll angle) improves.
Off-rolling does thermally destablise the PSF to some extent - by
changing the angle to the sub-solar point on the Earth as the
telescope orbits and can drive quasi-breathing modes.  I am a bit
surprised that these stabilize out as well as they seem to do (as
exhibited by the factor of 10 improvement in chisq).  It would be
interesting to know how much of that improvement is do to "same
dither position" and how much to "same roll" (as differently binned).
I am sure they both play together to reduce the residuals, but
knowing this could have influence on how future observations might be
constructed.</p>

<p>Overall, these look good; the question is, of course, how much of the
apparent trend is real.  One note here: It is curious how both A and B
have an increase in the first 3 orbits and then a different behavior
in orbits 4-6.</p>

<p>Could you explain how exactly do you determine the normalization
factors for the different angles/dithering positions?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I median combined the fluxes calculated with images taking with same
filter, dithering position and roll angles, and devided the median
combination from every photometric result of these exposures. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Daniel asks: "how much of the apparent trend is real".  This might be
difficult to ascertain.  Clearly the F125W and F160W for A seem well
correlated (1st 3 vs last 3 orbits) , but that correlation possibly
could still be instrumental.  If you took the new light curves as
binned, for B:</p>

<p>if you average all the points together in each orbit (loosing the
 finer temporal information) is the change in normalized flux for B
 over the six orbits also "consistent" from F125W to F160W <strong>AND</strong> is it
 correlated with A?  It's a little harder to tell (quantitatively) as
 plotted for B simply because it is noisier than A.  In both A and B
 (both bands) the flux (by eye) also seems lower in the last three
 orbits and MAYBE the is a small secular rise in orbits 1-3.  I would
 expect that behavior in A and B to be independent, whereas if
 correalted that may be an instrumental signature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>New plot needed. Plot the correlation of A and B with orbit combined points</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This looks quite nice and indeed, the 10.9 hours is not a period that
I would obviously associate with an instrumental artifact.  Have you
tried the same for the F160W LC? It would be a nice verification if
you would get a similar periodicity.</p>

<p>Also, to be consistent, can you please use the same fitting procedure
for A (in both filters) and send similar plots?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>New fitting for other light curves needed</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) 10.9 hours is also not a period associated with any spacecraft or
OTA operations I can think of and is longer than the OTA structure
thermal timescale.  This does not rule out something instrumental
(systemic WFC3+telescope+spacecraft{guiding system}) going on
unexpected - but no red flags pop out to me.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(b) Daniel asks/suggests: "Have you tried the same for the F160W LC?
It would be a nice verification if you would get a similar
periodicity."  Wgich indeed would be very good to look at.  Of course
while one would 'expect' the same period due to BD rotation, the phase
and amplitude of course might be different at different wavlength if
intrinsic, but not so (I think) if instrumental.</p>

<p>(c) I assume the 10.9 hour fit came from a least-squares analysis --
not quite a full observing/sampling period.  "By eye" it certainly
loooks good, but might be interesting to also do a simple periodogram
analysis, just to see if this might be an alias?</p>
